This flower's petals curve backward and are speckled with brown spots. Because of this so-called ""recurving"" (as well as the dark spots), they are reminiscent of the blooms of Turk's cap lilies (Lilium superbum). The plants' long style and six long stamens stick out from the bottom of the flower.",Perennial,,"Tiger lilies are an aggressively invasive species and will take over your garden if you let them. Propagate this plant by bulbil or by bulb division. Ideally, this should be done during the spring before it starts to grow anew, but you can divide them in the fall in warmer climates.

Bulb division requires digging up the entire plant carefully when it is dormant and gently separating the individual bulbs. Replant your bulbs as separate plants with the pointed side aimed upward.

Bulbils will form along the stem of the plant at leaf axils. If you wish to minimize spreading, remove the bulbils and dispose of them. Or, if you wish to propagate more, you can carefully remove the bulbils and pot them as if they were bulbs to grow a new plant. These will take an extra year of time before they begin to bloom, so it is a slower growth process.","Tiger lilies have just average water needs. After the plants are established, they are somewhat drought tolerant. They often thrive with existing rainfall.",Blooms Summer,"Tiger lilies are poisonous to cats. The most dangerous and potentially life-threatening flowers to cats are true lilies belonging to the Lilium genus and daylilies (Hemerocallis).
