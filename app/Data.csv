6 inches (15 cm) of water are enough for most species, although some may require a greater depth.

Spread rocks over the soil to keep it from floating back up.
Once your basket is ready, immerse it in water. Ideally, let it rest about 24 inches (60 cm) deep.
Once properly settled in, your water lily won’t need any follow-up and will simply bloom year after year without even needing to touch it.

There exist special baskets at horticulture stores, they help water circulate well without letting the soil disperse throughout the water basin.There are even specific soil mix preparations for aquatic plants.","needs small body of water
